# Exercise Sheet 3: Principal Component Analysis

Check the steps from the readme of exercise 1 to get started with working with Anaconda / virtual environments.

The accompanying material includes a [Jupyter notebook](PCA.ipynb) which 
should be used as a template for your solution. The material also 
includes the datasets and some Python code you may use. 

We decided to provide the solutions for the first part of the bonus task 3.7 which applies 
PCA to the HOG features of the data instead of applying PCA to the data directly.

When you have worked on the tasks from sheet 3, stage and push your work to your repository until __May 20th__. Create a pull request with the changes you made.
