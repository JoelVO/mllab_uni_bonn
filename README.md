Repository containing my submitions for the practical course on machine learning taken at the University of Bonn in which we studied different artificial intelligence techniques.

For my final project, I made a translator from english sign language to english using the HAgrid data set [1] and yolo v5 [2] as a object classifier. To test it, I recorded myself doing random signs and added different noises, which you can see in result.avi.
