Please refer to the sheet for more information on the exercises, especially which ones CAN BE SKIPPED by Bachelor students!

The interfaces, code snippets, and parameters provided in the notebook are supposed to help you, not restrain you. If you feel like the suggested architecture or variables do not work for you, feel free to change them!

I hope you find the materials interesting and instructive! Good luck!
