# Exercise-2

Check the steps from the readme of exercise 1 to get started with working with Anaconda / virtual environments.

You will need to use the MNIST data set in part 2.4.2 from the exercise sheet. You can find the data in e-campus.

Hint: you can have a look at the i-th training data set via (if you imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt)

plt.imshow(X_train[i,:,:], cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest') 

When you have worked on the tasks from sheet 2, stage and push your work to your repository. Create a pull request with the changes you made.
